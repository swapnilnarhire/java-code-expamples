This repository contains Java programs based on recent conversations. Each program addresses a specific problem with a short explanation and code for implementation.

## Programs

### 1. **Shortest Path in Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**

**Problem Statement**:  
Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.

**File**: `DijkstraAlgorithm.java`

**Description**:  
This program implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to calculate the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.

**How to Run**:
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac DijkstraAlgorithm.java
